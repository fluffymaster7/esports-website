      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>Flashing lights, gun shots, and a bomb ticking over all of this. This valorant, a hero based csgo clone. The summer of 2020 really sparked my interest in this game. After my overwatch addiction during online school year, my friends not only introduced valorant to me; but got me addicted to it. This addiction was just like any other you just can't get enough of it; but this one was just slightly different. With my overwatch addiction it was during the school year which meant I had half the time to play. But with summer starting I really had all the time in the world. One night I was scrolling through tiktok to see the best player known at that time "Tenz". Tenz was a content creator for cloud9 during the time, but as would soon be signed into sentinels roster for VCT. This took my addiction through the roof, playing non stop to get to at tenz's play level. As a new player who just started playing weeks ago was now a half way through all the ranks. With every addiction, it takes a toll on you, school started back up but this time it was in person. Meaning my valorant "grind time" would be cut down to a fourth of my 14 hour play time. But through the year I have to work with it by playing for less and less each day. Present day, I still love playing valorant but now I have time to.</p>
